    "This first recipe covers essential features of `gospl` in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. Over the course of this recipe, you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ data structure used in `gospl` input file,\n",
    "+ how to generate simple initial conditions like topography, tectonic and precipitation to force a simulation,\n",
    "+ how to extract some of the outputs from the model to visualise them in Jupyter notebooks using multiple approaches/libraries,\n",
    "+ how to export `gospl` outputs (hdf5) in other common formats such as netcdf, geotiff, ZMap, and\n",
    "+ how to extract information relative to drainge basins and rivers longitudinal profiles.\n",

    "The simulation proposed here uses data freely available from the web and will run **without additional dataset**. The dataset are imported in the jupyter notebooks from the following `THREDDS` servers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Topography file from NOAA [ETOPO5](http://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/pmel/thredds/dodsC/data/PMEL/etopo5.nc.html),\n",
    "2. Precipitation file from  the [CPC collection](https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/dodsC/Datasets/cmap/enh/precip.mon.mean.nc.html).\n",

    "In this example, we show how to use the global model to run a simulation for a particular continental-scale region here the Gulf of Mexico. This is done by building an unstructured spherical mesh with high resolution (approx. 25 km) around North America and a coarse (>1000 km) elsewhere. \n",

    ":::{note}\n",
    "The recipe should take around 20/30 minutes to do on a single CPU (actually the simulation itself runs in less than 5 minutes but you will need time to understand how to build the input files and perform the provided post-processing analysis). Obviously, `gospl` can be ran at much higher resolution (<10 km) globally but will take much more time!\n",

    "The recipe is actually a coarser version of the following simulation which takes a bit longer to run but has been built using the exct same notebooks.\n",
