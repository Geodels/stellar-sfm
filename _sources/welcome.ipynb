    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "[MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) is a service that allows us to provide online computing environments in which the course notebooks can be read and executed. This is a fantastic service that runs on the cloud - each time a user clicks on the top binder link, a so-called “virtual machine” is spun-up and made accessible via the web-browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**These binder environments are safe, anonymous, and temporary**. Temporary means non-persistent: if you close the tab in which the environment was opened, it is lost. If you open the link again, a new environment will be created for you, without your previous modifications. Therefore, if you want to save your work for later (i.e. to be able to upload it in a future binder session), don’t forget to download the files you modified before leaving. **Be aware that a Binder environment will be shut down after 10 minutes of inactivity** (leaving your tab/window open will count as “activity” only if visible, i.e. leaving the tab open but navigating elsewhere will eventually shut down your session).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MyBinder is a free service provided generously by the Binder and Jupyter communities ([FAQ](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)). As such, you can expect some waiting time at launch and relatively limited computer resources. However, these resources should be more than enough to run the course notebooks at home or in class.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to set up a full-stack scientific Python deployment is to use a Python distribution. This is an installation of Python with a set of curated packages which are guaranteed to work together. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start using the `gospl` recipies presented in this documentation, we recommend the **[Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)**. Follow the previous link to obtain a one-click installer for Linux, Mac, or Windows. (Make sure you select the **Python 3** installer) In addition to the packages themselves, Anaconda includes a graphical utility to help manage any packages you may want to install which are not already included in the default inclusion list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes assume you have access to a Unix command line to type in shell commands. For Linux and MacOS users, you can access the command line by opening the terminal program. It’s more difficult for Windows users. For Windows users, you should first install Anaconda (described above) or Miniconda (described below), which gives you access to the “Anaconda Prompt” desktop app. (Instructions for this are given on the [Andaconda Website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#write-a-python-program-using-anaconda-prompt-or-terminal).) From the Anaconda Prompt, you should be able to run `conda` and other shell commands.\n",

    "### Lightweight alternative: Miniconda\n",

    "If you are installing python on a remote machine via ssh, or you simply don’t want to download a huge file like the Anaconda Python Distribution, there is a lightweight alternative installation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Obtain a minimal Python installer** We recommend the [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installer; this provides a Python install for your operating system, plus the conda package manager. This way, you can only install the packages you *want*.\n",
    "- **Run the installer** You’ll probably need to do this from the command line, *e.g.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions; you can choose where to place the installation ( preferably somewhere you have write access without super-user/root access, like your home directory). At the end of this process, add this path to your *rc configuration*\n",

    "    $ echo \". $HOME/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\" > ~/.bashrc\n",

    "    \n",
    "This will create a special environment in `$MINICONDA_HOME/envs/my_environment` with only Python and numpy to begin with. Here, we’ve also told `conda` to install Python version 3.8; you can specify exact versions or minima, and `conda` will take care of figuring out all the compatibilties between versions for you. To use this environment, simply “activate” it by executing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ conda activate my_environment\n",
    "    \n",
    "Regardless of your shell, you should now see the string (`my_environment`) prepended to your prompt. Now, if you execute any Python-related tool from the command line, it will first search in `$MINICONDA_HOME/envs/my_environment/bin` to find them. You can deactivate your environment by typing:\n",
